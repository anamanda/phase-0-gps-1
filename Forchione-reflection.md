I was struggling with getting the hang of the proper git workflow. Like when to create a branch, etc. 
The basic Git workflow was solidified more for me. Especially working with Amanda, she really understood it which helped me out a lot. 
I had a few question for Amanda, like when to create a branch, and for some reason I kept trying to push the directory or file to GitHub rather than the branch itself. 
I think I more or less have the hang of Git. 
It was a good first experience!
