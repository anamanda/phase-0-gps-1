*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with its association with GitHub and how a project that is done on the local server can synch with its respective repository on a remote server. The workflow confused me the most.

Besides this, I struggled a bit with the concept of branches, and how files in different branches look different from one another.


*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GitHub workflow was definitely clarified during the GPS. We discussed the basic commands for pushing a local repository up to a remote repository, and the difference between both repositories. The concept of the master branch became a lot clearer to me too during the session.


*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We asked our guide how to push our local Git repository up to GitHub, and what we were doing by making a 'pull request.' I asked my pair if she knew anything about the difference between the HTTPS and SSH clone URL. When we had questions, the other one usually knew the answer (or helped find one).


*What still confuses you about Git?
While the Git / GitHub workflow is **much** clearer to me now, it is still a concept I'm not 100% on. I think it will be a matter of practice, though. The more I work with the Git flow, the more I'll understand what I'm doing. While I can work with it, it'll definitely become a clearer picture to me through use.


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was really cool. It's nice to be able to work with someone, and there was also the added comfort of a guide there to help us when we couldn't help each other. Our guide was great. She let us do our work, but knew when to chime in and give us a hand. I'm glad it was my first pairing experience.
